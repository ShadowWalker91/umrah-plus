    description: "The original sacred space of Islam, embodying the eternal themes of trust, comfort, and unwavering faith.",
    history: `
      <p style="text-align: justify;">This Ziyarat is a pilgrimage to the genesis of the Ummah. The House of Khadijah (R.A.) witnessed the first revelation, the first profession of faith, the birth of all the Prophet's (S.A.W.) children who reached maturity, and the Prophet's (S.A.W.) most sustained period of marital and spiritual support.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #F9C344;">Khadijah al-Kubra (R.A.)</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">To understand the significance of the house is to understand the status of its owner. Sayyidah Khadijah (R.A.) was a woman of immense stature—a successful merchant, known in Makkah as <strong>al-Tahirah (The Pure One)</strong>—who chose to marry the young Muhammad (S.A.W.) for his integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness (al-Amin).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The house served as the couple's residence for over 25 years, covering the entirety of the period before Prophethood and the first 10 years of the difficult Dawah period in Makkah.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #F9C344;">The Barakah of Trust and Wealth</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Barakah associated with this home is one of unwavering trust and financial sacrifice. The Prophet (S.A.W.) lived here from the age of 25 until his migration to Madinah.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; color: #d1d5db;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Emotional Refuge:</strong> When persecution began, the Prophet (S.A.W.) would return to this home to find solace, encouragement, and understanding. Khadijah (R.A.) used her status and vast wealth to support the Dawah, freeing slaves who accepted Islam and financially sustaining the small, persecuted community.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>The Mother of the Believers:</strong> In this house, Khadijah (R.A.) bore the Prophet (S.A.W.) all his children who reached maturity, including the most beloved, Fatimah (R.A.). She earned the revered title <strong>Umm al-Mu’minīn (Mother of the Believers)</strong> through her singular role as the first Muslim and the first pillar of the Prophet’s (S.A.W.) domestic life.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #F9C344;">What Became of the House?</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The physical house stood near the area of the Masjid al-Haram, specifically in the Banu Hashim district, close to the location where the Prophet (S.A.W.) was born. Over the centuries, the sanctity of the site was recognized by successive Muslim rulers, who preserved it and often turned it into a small mosque.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Today, due to the massive expansions of the Masjid al-Haram, the exact footprint of the house is contained within the expanded mosque complex, near the Marwah side. While the original structure is no longer visible, the location is a point of powerful reflection, symbolizing the immense sacrifices made in the first decade of Islam.</p>

       <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #F9C344;">The Lesson of the Foundation</h3>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">The Ziyarat to the site of the House of Khadijah (R.A.) is a visit to the spiritual wellspring of the Ummah.</p>
       <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; color: #d1d5db;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>The Barakah of Partnership:</strong> It teaches the paramount importance of a supportive spouse and home life in the spiritual mission. Khadijah’s (R.A.) trust gave the Prophet (S.A.W.) the emotional stability to face the persecution of the entire city.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>The Power of Sincerity:</strong> The house is a reminder that the greatest acts of faith begin in humility and sincerity—the first believer was a woman who used her wealth and status entirely for the sake of Allah (S.W.T.).</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 16px;"><strong>Standing near the location of this house, the pilgrim should feel the warmth of that early faith, remembering the strength, love, and protection that emanated from the cradle of Prophethood.</strong></p>
